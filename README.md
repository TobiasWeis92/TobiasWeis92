### Hey guys ✌🏻 
My name is Tobias,
I'm a health scientist with a love for everything that has to do with data - data analysis, data visualization, data storytelling, you name it.
Always excited to learn new things in this area I'm currently enrolled in a Data Analytics Bootcamp at neuefische GmbH.
